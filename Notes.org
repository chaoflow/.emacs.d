#+SEQ_TODO: TODO CHECK | DONE

* wishlist/status
** python
based on elpy, needs testing
*** DONE eldoc error: (void-variable virtualenv-workon-session)
CLOSED: [2013-05-21 Tue 18:02]

hopefully fixed by 7a5b471.
** org-mode
*** DONE It looks like indentation of normal text is off
CLOSED: [2013-05-11 Sat 13:11]

This is shown at the very beginning of the line, I'm pretty sure it
used to be shown indented.

Indentation works again. Not sure why.
** calendar views

** address book
*** what possibilities are there?
**** org-contacts
http://julien.danjou.info/projects/emacs-packages#org-contacts
- contacts as headlines with properties
- integration into message mode
- new contacts through captures

***** @coroa: how would/could that be used for notmuch address completion?
a simple
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-contacts (concat site-lisp-dir "/org-mode/contrib/lisp/org-contacts"))
(setq org-contacts-files '("~/notes/contacts.org"))
#+end_src
should automatically provide tab completion in message-mode of
contacts from ~/notes/contacts.org (if org-contacts-files is nil all
agenda files will be used instead).

a typical capture template would look like this (from org-contacts.el)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ("c" "Contacts" entry (file "~/Org/contacts.org")
   "* %(org-contacts-template-name)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EMAIL: %(org-contacts-template-email)
  :END:")
#+end_src

**** BBDBv3
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bbdb/
- integration into message mode
- fast searching and editing through dedicated keybindings
- new contacts through dialog.
*** It feels just an org file could do it
**** grep the org file for email addresses and use these for notmuch
** Issues
*** DONE find: `elpa/ecukes-*/ecukes': No such file or directory
CLOSED: [2013-05-21 Tue 18:04]
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/cfl/.emacs.d/site-lisp/tagedit'
carton exec  features
make[1]: carton: Command not found
make[1]: *** [all] Error 127

**** DONE elpa/ecukes should not be installed by elpa
CLOSED: [2013-05-21 Tue 18:04]
try removing the directory alltogether. one can always remove
everything in there freely. it will always be pulled back in at the
next start of emacs.

@coroa: I don'd have elpa/cukes*, the error message is shown in the
first lines of make output

carton is a command line manager for elpa

ecukes is a unit/regression testing tool for emacs

all the makefile basically would do is getting all dependencies from
elpa and then run some unit tests against the code, if carton was
installed.

i would propose to ignore the warning, there is no functionality
impeded by it. alternatively i can look into packaging carton from
https://github.com/rejeep/carton.
*** DONE during org html export: run-hooks: Symbol's function definition is void: adaptive-wrap-prefix-mode
CLOSED: [2013-05-15 Wed 17:32]
this was probably due to calling on unavailable mode in html-mode-hook
(cfl). commented out.

*** DONE magit-status destroys window layout. should be in current window?
CLOSED: [2013-05-21 Tue 17:58]
this is a FEATURE, NOT A BUG introduced in setup-magit.el. i'm
unanimous in this regard, so i commented the respective lines out.

Will see how this feels. It looks like the "restoring window
configuration" part is broken in the feature.

Hmm ... just tried again, and it seems to work for me (coroa)
*** DONE paste at point of cursor instead of mouse pointer
CLOSED: [2013-05-21 Tue 17:55]
middle mouse click

C-h k Middle-mouse-click tells me that the function run on
middle mouse click is mouse-yank-primary, which inserts at point if
the variable mouse-yank-at-point is non-nil.

added to chaoflows config.

*** TODO Proper color themes
some ideas, open for suggestions. At most I have strong opinions but
actually no clue what is good. Is there a point in having low
contrast?
**** TODO high contrast, white background
for working in the sun
**** TODO high contrast, dark background
for working in dark surroundings
